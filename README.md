**Work in Progress**

Code and data for chapter 1 of my PhD thesis:

> What are the cross-city drivers of regulatory ecosystem services provided by the urban forest in Canadian temperate cities?

Using existing, publicly available data to test temperature regulation, air pollution mitigation, and carbon storage capacity and their drivers in seven major, southern, temperate cities that span the east-west coasts of Canada: Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax. We will test drivers of ecosystem services at three scales within the cities, fine-scale (street level), medium-scale (neighbourhood level), and large-scale (city level).

**Run the workflow**

Note: current runtime is ~ 12 hours
